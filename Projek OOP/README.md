# Basketball Team Manager 🏀

## 📌 Description

This application was inspired by my personal hobby of playing basketball. I often wanted to record my teammates' performance, organise the roster, and save information about the coach and my basketball team's match results. Therefore, I created this application to help record player and coach data and save it for future use.

This application is built using **Python and OOP** with an approach based on **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and data storage using **JSON files**. The application interface is built using **Tkinter GUI** for ease of use.
